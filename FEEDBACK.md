### Reflection

Take some time to think about your process during this assessment: What worked? What could you have done better? What should you keep doing?

* I feel I start thinking in the React way: components, properties going down, call-back functions 'going up', but I get mixed up regularly.
* I am getting more familiar with the Component extension in the Developer tools
* React breaks easily: endless renderings, too many renderings, cryptic error messages. Takes a lot of time to find the cause and fix
* I thought the Routing part at the end would be easy, but it took a lot of time to get it right and without errors/warnings. I still need to figure out how to define a route for the root (without adding a new page)
* Though I did not use ChatGPT, I used the course material a lot to find 'code-snippets' for re-use.
