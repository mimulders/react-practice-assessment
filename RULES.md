## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the main learning goals we will be testing:

- Creating components
- Nesting components and passing them data via props
- Using event listeners and event handlers, like onClick
- Designing and managing component local state with useState hook
- Using the useEffect hook to fetch data from an API using Axios
- Using react-router-dom to make static and dynamic routes
- Using npm to install packages

Additional learning goals include:

- Creating input forms and console logging the results
- Mapping, filtering, finding & sorting arrays of objects
- CSS styling
- Basic git and GitHub usage: making commits, adding remote & pushing to master

If this sounds like a large list, it is, and it's because you've learned a tremendous amount of things these past week! Don't let it scare or overwhelm you though, you have seen all these things. See the rules above for resources you are allowed to use

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.

**TIP: Focus on the required features first!** Before moving to the bonus sections of this assessment, focus on implementing the madatory parts, then move on to the next ones.

## What are we building?

We are building a webapp for a Harry Potter fanclub. We want the following features:

#### Required Features

- HomePage that says "Welcome to the Harry Potter site!"

  - On homepage we have a button that says "View character list" that navigates to the character list page

- Character List page

  - Use API /characters
  - Each character is separate component, and should show only their name and image
  - Each character can be liked and favorited
    - When character is liked, a counter of likes increase
    - When character is favorited, a star appears. If they are unfavorited, the star disappears
  - The total number of likes is at the top of the character list page
  - Each characters has a "see details" button that takes them to their detail page

- Character Detail page
  - List all the details for each character (quote, birthday, etc.)
  - Uses /characters/:id API

#### Bonus Features

- Bonus things you can try:
  - Add filter to character list page, like filter by name or patronus, or birthday month
  - Add a button that can also decrease the amount of likes for each character
  - Add ability to sort character list by different things, like alphabetical order
  - Add a new page from home page to "add new student"
    - This new page should have an input form to enter info about the new student
    - Console log this info

## API

The data for this app is already available through an API. This way you can build your entire app without having to create a working API yourself.
